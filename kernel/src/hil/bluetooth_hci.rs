//! Interface for a Bluetooth HCI transport that carries H4 packets.
//!
//! An HCI transport connects a Bluetooth host to a Bluetooth controller. The
//! client of this interface is the host. The implementation connects to the
//! controller.
//!
//! # Packet format
//!
//! Every packet on this interface is an H4 packet. An H4 packet starts with a
//! one-byte packet type. The type byte is followed by one HCI packet of that
//! type. The Bluetooth Core Specification defines the H4 packet types in
//! Vol 4, Part A, Section 2. It defines the HCI packets in Vol 4, Part E,
//! Section 5.4.
//!
//! This interface carries the packet types in [`PacketType`]. The table
//! lists the length of each H4 packet. `p` is the H4 packet.
//!
//! | Type                     | Direction          | Length of the H4 packet                |
//! |--------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
//! | [`PacketType::Command`]  | host to controller | `4 + p[3]`                             |
//! | [`PacketType::AclData`]  | both               | `5 + u16::from_le_bytes([p[3], p[4]])` |
//! | [`PacketType::Event`]    | controller to host | `3 + p[2]`                             |
//!
//! An H4 packet is well-formed if its type is in this table and its length
//! equals the length in the table. This interface carries packets of at most
//! [`MAX_PACKET_LEN`] bytes.
//!
//! # States
//!
//! The transport is stopped after boot. The client starts the transport by
//! calling [`HciTransport::reset`]. The transport is ready after it calls
//! [`HciTransportClient::reset_done`] with `Ok(())`. The transport is stopped
//! again after it calls [`HciTransportClient::stopped`]. The client calls
//! `reset` to start it again.
//!
//! # Guarantees
//!
//! The implementation provides these guarantees to the client:
//!
//! - It does not call a client method from within a method of
//!   [`HciTransport`].
//! - It delivers packets in the order in which the controller produced them.
//! - It delivers only well-formed event and ACL data packets of at most
//!   [`MAX_PACKET_LEN`] bytes. It discards other packets from the controller.
//! - It calls [`HciTransportClient::transmit_done`] exactly once for every
//!   call to [`HciTransport::transmit`] that returned `Ok(())`.
//! - It does not call [`HciTransportClient::packet_received`] while receive
//!   is disabled.
//! - It does not discard packets while receive is disabled. The controller
//!   can still discard packets when its own buffers are full.
