//! Hardware-independent kernel interface for deferred calls
//!
//! This allows any struct in the kernel which implements
//! [DeferredCallClient](crate::deferred_call::DeferredCallClient)
//! to set and receive deferred calls, Tock's version of software
//! interrupts.
//!
//! These can be used to implement long-running in-kernel algorithms
//! or software devices that are supposed to work like hardware devices.
//! Essentially, this allows the chip to handle more important interrupts,
//! and lets a kernel component return the function call stack up to the scheduler,
//! automatically being called again.
//!
//! Usage
//! -----
//!
//! The `DEFCALLS` array size determines how many
//! [DeferredCall](crate::deferred_call::DeferredCall)s
//! may be registered. By default this is set to 32.
//! To support more deferred calls, this file would need to be modified
//! to use a larger variable for BITMASK (e.g. BITMASK could be a u64
//! and the array size increased to 64).
//! If more than 32 deferred calls are created, the kernel will panic
//! at the beginning of the kernel loop.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use crate::deferred_call::{DeferredCall, DeferredCallClient};
//! struct SomeCapsule {
//!     deferred_call: DeferredCall
//! }
//! impl SomeCapsule {
//!     pub fn new() -> Self {
//!         Self {
//!             deferred_call: DeferredCall::new(),
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! impl DeferredCallClient for SomeCapsule {
//!     fn handle_deferred_call(&self) {
//!         // Your action here
//!     }
//!
//!     fn register(&'static self) {
//!         self.deferred_call.register(self);
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // main.rs or your component must register the capsule with
//! // its deferred call.
//! // This should look like:
//! let some_capsule = unsafe { static_init!(SomeCapsule, SomeCapsule::new()) };
//! some_capsule.register();
//! ```
